## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help 

I used w3schools.com to see what other Javascript color options I had.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

My primary browser seemed to have issues running the code correctly and would not play any of the tones at all. I then tried running the game on my secondary browser, which worked slightly better but still would not play the tones. I looked over my code many times for errors and found none. There was nothing wrong with my laptop of browser setting either. Finally, I asked my roommate, who isn't a CS major, what they thought. Just so happens they had taken a 3-hour HTML class once in middle school and only remembered HTML works well in Firefox "for whatever reason" she said. I looked into it and she was right. So I tried Firefox and it worked! Never would have guessed.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I'd like to learn about how and why web browsers work differently. Do web developers normally work on entire projects themselves from start to finish or is the job more divided? Using the memory game as an example, would one developer be tasked solely with writing the Javascript while another worked on the HTML and CSS components? I'd want to know more about how web developers operate as a whole. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I had more time I would definitely learn more about HTML and CSS in order to step up the visual design of the game. My goal would be to achieve a cleaner, more cohesive layout with different text fonts, buttons with more dimension, and colors that compliment each other better. I'd also like to put the strike counter somewhere on the screen instead of having it pop up as an alert. Also, I would add some customization settings to allow the player to set the difficulty, number of buttons, speed, etc.
